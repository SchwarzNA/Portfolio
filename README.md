# Personal Portfolio React App 🚀

Welcome to my **Personal Portfolio** project! This website was created for my **Midterm Task Performance** in building a React-based portfolio, featuring routing, a modern design, and a dark/light mode toggle. 

## ✨ Overview

- **Objective**: Create a portfolio website to showcase my projects, about information, and contact details.
- **Tech Stack**: 
  - React (with create-react-app)
  - React Router for navigation
  - CSS (or styled-components, etc.) for styling
  - Web Vitals for performance measurement (optional but recommended)

## 📜 Midterm Task Performance Details

**Midterm Task**:  
1. Build a responsive and visually appealing **React** application.  
2. Implement **React Router** for multi-page routing (e.g., Home, Projects, About, Contact).  
3. Add a **Dark/Light** mode toggle to provide a modern user experience.  
4. Document the steps in this README.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone and run the portfolio locally on your machine.

```

> **Note**: Some boilerplate or manual setups might require installing `web-vitals` to measure performance or avoid errors.

### Step 4: Start the Development Server
